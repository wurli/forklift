# Forklift

A shell script to ease the cognitive load of working with agentic CLI tools.

(Note: currently only supports the Copilot CLI).

## Installation
You can use `curl` to install Forklift from GitHub. Make sure to install the
script to a location on the `PATH`!

``` sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wurli/forklift/refs/heads/main/forklift -o "$HOME/.local/bin/forklift"
```

## Usage
The best way to use Forklift is by setting up a `tmux` keybinding to open in a
new window. I use `<tmux-leader>i` like so:

``` tmux
bind-key -r i run-shell "tmux neww forklift"
```

You can also run Forklift from the shell:
``` sh
forklift [<branch-name>]
```

## The problem

While agentic CLI tools can be very helpful for some tasks, there is a
significant cost associated with them in that they *take the developer's focus
away from the code*. The developer usually needs to invest significant time and
attention, first to babysit the agent while it runs, then to clean up the
project when it's finished.

## The solution

Forklift works by asking the user once for a task, then setting the agent to
work with free reign over a separate, dedicated [Git
worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). When the agent finishes
working the worktree is deleted, leaving the user free to inspect the changes,
e.g. using `git diff`.

## Disclaimer

Forklift currently gives the agent free-reign over its worktree, but does
**not** provide any guardrails beyond instructions in the initial prompt to
stop it changing other files or Git branches. Please only use Forklift to the
extent that you trust the agent you're using!
